		<h1>Val</h1>
		<p>The almost unknown little hamlet of Val is about 30 minutes from Heidelberg in Gauteng and only a stone's throw from Greylingstad on the road to Standerton. It is surely one of the smallest, cleanest and most beautiful little towns on the highveld and with only 28 inhabitants, is really worth a visit.<br /><br />

Andr&eacute; and Rita Britz bought almost the whole town in an auction in 1994, including the dilapidated old "Val Hotel". The hotel has been lovingly restored it to its former glory. The couple had reason to be excited about their acquisition: Rita's ancestors, the Van den Berg, Steyn and Engelbrecht families, had been farmers at Val for eight generations since 1886 &amp; Andr&eacute; and Rita got married at the Val Church in 1982. Today the Val Hotel offers a cozy private pub, large fireplaces and spacious entertaining areas for functions, conferences, weddings and all celebrations of life. The small and beautiful thatched chapel further down the road is becoming a very popular wedding venue from where bridal pairs and their guests move to the Val Hotel for intimate country wedding receptions.
